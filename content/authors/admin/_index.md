Hey, I'm a **Machine Learning Researcher | Neural Networks & Applied AI**

I am a machine learning researcher and engineer focused on building efficient neural network architectures for real-world applications. My work spans deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, with a strong emphasis on representation learning, scalability, and deployment-ready AI systems.

I work on neural network–driven intelligence systems that operate under complex data distributions, limited resources, and real-world constraints, translating theoretical ideas into robust, practical models that perform reliably beyond controlled settings.

My goal is to create AI systems that are efficient, interpretable, and usable at scale, bridging cutting-edge research with production-ready deployment.

## Current Research

Currently, I am working as a **Research Intern** at the **Computer Vision Lab, IIT Mandi**, where I focus on small object detection in high-resolution remote sensing imagery. My research specifically targets objects below 32 x 32 pixels under severe background clutter and scale imbalance, incorporating innovative multi-scale feature fusion with global context modeling.

## Research Focus

My research contributions include:
- **YOLO Architecture Redesign**: Incorporating customized feature enhancement, multi-scale feature fusion, and global context modeling
- **Contextual Representation Learning**: Multi-branch convolutional structures and receptive field expansion
- **Feature Fusion Strategies**: Mitigating semantic inconsistencies between shallow and deep feature representations
- **Global Context Modeling**: Capturing long-range spatial and cross-channel dependencies
- **Deployment Optimization**: Optimizing inference latency, memory footprint, and parameter efficiency

## Technical Expertise

**Programming Languages**: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript  
**ML/AI Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
**Tools & Technologies**: Git, Docker, Linux, SQL, MongoDB, React, Node.js

## Recent Achievements

🏆 **Finalist** - IIT Guwahati Techniche Tech-Expo 2025 (Top 30 out of 2400 teams)  
🥇 **Rank 76** - IIT Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon (Kshitij) 2025  
🏅 **First Prize** - College Research Paper Competition  
📄 **Research Paper Under Review** - "IoT for Sustainable Resource Management"

When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying updated with the latest developments in AI and computer vision.
