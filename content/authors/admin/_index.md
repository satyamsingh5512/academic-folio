Welcome to my academic portfolio! 👋

I am a passionate researcher specializing in deep learning and computer vision at IIT Mandi. I focus on developing lightweight neural architectures for small object detection in remote sensing imagery, with expertise in YOLO-based architectures, multi-scale feature fusion, and deployment-ready AI systems.

Currently, I am working as a **Research Intern** at the **Computer Vision Lab, IIT Mandi**, where I focus on small object detection in high-resolution remote sensing imagery. My research specifically targets objects below 32 x 32 pixels under severe background clutter and scale imbalance, incorporating innovative multi-scale feature fusion with global context modeling.

I am pursuing my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering** at **NIST University, Berhampur, Odisha**, maintaining an exceptional **CGPA of 8.98/10**. My academic journey combines rigorous coursework in machine learning, computer vision, and software engineering with hands-on research experience.

## Research Focus

My research contributions include:
- **YOLO Architecture Redesign**: Incorporating customized feature enhancement, multi-scale feature fusion, and global context modeling
- **Contextual Representation Learning**: Multi-branch convolutional structures and receptive field expansion
- **Feature Fusion Strategies**: Mitigating semantic inconsistencies between shallow and deep feature representations
- **Global Context Modeling**: Capturing long-range spatial and cross-channel dependencies
- **Deployment Optimization**: Optimizing inference latency, memory footprint, and parameter efficiency

## Technical Expertise

**Programming Languages**: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript  
**ML/AI Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
**Tools & Technologies**: Git, Docker, Linux, SQL, MongoDB, React, Node.js

## Recent Achievements

🏆 **Finalist** - IIT Guwahati Techniche Tech-Expo 2025 (Top 30 out of 2400 teams)  
🥇 **Rank 76** - IIT Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon (Kshitij) 2025  
🏅 **First Prize** - College Research Paper Competition  
📄 **Research Paper Under Review** - "IoT for Sustainable Resource Management"

When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying updated with the latest developments in AI and computer vision.
