        **Research Focus**: Small object detection in high-resolution remote sensing imagery, with specific emphasis on objects below 32 x 32 pixels under severe background clutter and scale imbalance.
        
        **Key Contributions**:
        * **YOLO Architecture Redesign**: Redesigned YOLO-based detection architectures by incorporating customized feature enhancement, multi-scale feature fusion, and global context modeling components.
        * **Contextual Representation Learning**: Investigated local contextual representation learning through multi-branch convolutional structures and receptive field expansion.
        * **Feature Fusion Strategies**: Developed refined multi-scale feature fusion strategies to mitigate semantic inconsistencies between shallow and deep feature representations.
        * **Global Context Modeling**: Integrated global context modeling mechanisms to capture long-range spatial and cross-channel dependencies.
        * **Deployment Optimization**: Optimized inference latency, memory footprint, and parameter efficiency through architectural simplifications.
        
        **Innovation**: Multi-scale feature fusion with global context modeling, incorporating customized feature enhancement and channel-aware reweighting mechanisms.
        
        **Academic Performance**: CGPA: 8.98/10
